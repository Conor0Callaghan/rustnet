# Changelog

All notable changes to RustNet will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-28

### Added
- Created `RELEASE.md` and `ROADMAP.md` for better project organization
- Enhanced memory efficiency through enum variant boxing

### Fixed
- Major clippy warning cleanup (97% reduction from 38 to 1 warnings)
- Refactored functions using `TransportParams` struct to reduce complexity
- Fixed collapsible if patterns and improved code readability
- Eliminated needless borrows and manual implementations

### Changed
- Moved release documentation to dedicated files
- Streamlined README to focus on user information
- Improved code organization and Rust best practices

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- **Enhanced PKTAP Support on macOS**: Comprehensive process identification using macOS PKTAP (Packet Tap) headers
  - Direct extraction of process names and PIDs from kernel packet metadata
  - Robust handling of 20-byte PKTAP process name fields with proper normalization
  - Support for both `pth_comm` and `pth_e_comm` (effective command name) fields
  - Fallback to `lsof` system commands when PKTAP data is unavailable
- **Process Data Immutability System**: Once process information is set from any source, it becomes immutable to prevent display inconsistencies
- **Advanced Process Name Normalization**: Handles all types of whitespace, control characters, and padding in process names
- **Comprehensive Debug Logging**: Extensive logging for PKTAP header processing, process name extraction, and data flow tracking

### Fixed
- **Process Display Stability on macOS**: Fixed issue where process names would change format during UI scrolling (e.g., "firefox              (123)" â†’ "firefox (123)")
- **PKTAP Header Processing**: Improved parsing of raw PKTAP packet headers with better error handling and validation
- **Process Name Consistency**: Eliminated race conditions and data inconsistencies in process name display
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Fixed handling of tabs, multiple spaces, unicode whitespace, and control characters in process names

### Changed
- **Process Enrichment Logic**: Modified to respect existing PKTAP data and only fill in missing information from `lsof`
- **UI Rendering Optimization**: Simplified process name rendering to use pre-normalized data from sources
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting for PKTAP processing and process lookup failures

### Technical Details
- Implemented `extract_process_name_from_bytes()` function for robust PKTAP process name extraction
- Added immutability enforcement in connection merge logic with violation detection
- Enhanced macOS process lookup with `normalize_process_name_robust()` function
- Improved byte-level debugging and logging for process identification troubleshooting

### Platform-Specific Improvements
- **macOS**: PKTAP now provides primary process identification with significant performance and accuracy improvements over `lsof`-only approach
- **Linux**: Process enrichment logic updated to work consistently with new immutability system

## [0.1.0] - 2024-XX-XX

### Added
- Initial release of RustNet
- Real-time network connection monitoring
- Deep packet inspection (DPI) for HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, and QUIC
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Terminal user interface with ratatui
- Multi-threaded packet processing
- Process identification using platform-specific APIs
- Service name resolution
- Configurable refresh intervals and filtering options
- Optional logging with multiple log levels
